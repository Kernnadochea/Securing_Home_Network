# Securing_Home_Network

- Place your router in a central location.
  
- Secure Your Wi-Fi Network
  - Change your network’s SSID (Wi-Fi name) to something unique and disable SSID broadcast to make your network less visible to outsiders. Use Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA or WPA2) encryption to protect your wireless network.

- Create a strong Wi-Fi password and change it often.
  - Use complex and unique passwords for your Wi-Fi network and all connected devices. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like “123456” or “password.” Regularly update your passwords to further enhance your network’s security. When setting up a strong password, use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common words. The longer your password, the better. For my case the network password is automatically generated and stored in a password manager with 30 character long. 

- Change the default router login credentials.
  - Most routers come with default login credentials, making them vulnerable to attacks. Protect your network by changing the default username and password of your router. Choose a unique and strong password that is different from your Wi-Fi password. I have store the routers credentials within my password manager.

- Turn on firewall and Wi-Fi encryption.

- Create a guest network.
  - Creating a separate guest network for your visitors is a wise move. This network should have a different password and limited access to your leading network. By doing so, you can prevent guests from accessing your sensitive data while still providing internet access.

- Use a VPN
  - A VPN encrypts your internet connection, making it harder for hackers to intercept your data. Use a VPN whenever you’re accessing the internet, especially when using public Wi-Fi hotspots.

- Keep your router and devices up to date.
  - Regularly updating your router’s firmware is vital to safeguard against emerging threats. Router manufacturers often release firmware updates to fix security vulnerabilities and improve performance. Check for updates regularly and install them to ensure your network’s protection. A good habit is to check it once a month and have a reminder on my calender for the beginning of every month to see if there is a new update available. Turn on auto-update if your route allows that. 

- Enabled 2MFA

- Disable remote router access.
Disabled Enable Anywhere Access. Anywhere Access allows you to remotely access your products while you are away from your home network.

- Verify connected devices.

- Upgrade to a WPA3 router.
 - Setup WPA3-Personal if possible. If option is not available second best is WPA2-PSK [AES]
